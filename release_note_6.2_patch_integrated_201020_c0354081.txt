Realtek IOT AmebaD 6.2 SDK Release Note

We recommand the flow items:
1,  Apply the lastest Patch will make your project synchronize with our Git branch code, and will make it easier to analysis some issues or implement requirements
2,  Try not to modify the .c and .h files in default SDK. If you are obliged to do this, add your own marco between your code, and it will make it easier for you to merge Patch
	a) If the .c and .h files in Patch are not modified in your project, just copy and paste
	b) If the .c and .h files in Patch are modified in your project, use compare tool to only merge the difference which are not changed by yourself

		3, 	Fix BLE Mesh Bug
				Symptom:  Transmitter sometimes will miss the data trans model's acknowledge from the receiver.
				Reason: Data trans model's acknowledge may be collision with transmitter's retry packets, so rand delay mechanism is attached before receiver sending the acknowledge.
		
		4, 	Fix BLE Mesh Bug
				Symptom:  After "ATBm=1" and "ATBm=0", there is a memory leak.

				Symptom:  wifi reconnection may fail with 11k AP
				Reason: AP do not reply assoc request causing the AmebaD not deleting PMKSA Caching
			
		9，	Fix SoftAP Bug
				Symptom:  SoftAP may not receive Sta deauth frames
				Reason: management frame protection check is working in WPA2
		
		10，Fix Tickless Bug 
				Symptom： Lwip Timer may not timeout correctly， 30s timer may take several minutes to time out
				Reason:  Lwip timers are chain together, tickless wakeup need to adjust the tick

		6,	Optimize WIFI channel plan for new version
		
		7, 	Fix Tickless Bug
			Symptom: Interrupt will trigger during Sleep procedure, cause sleep fail
			Reason: During sleep procedure, rtw_read8/16/32 clear PRIMASK to enable interrupt response by mistake, which will break sleep procedure.

		8, 	Fix Tickless Bug
			Symptom: Entering log uart interrupt by mistake when the other core enable log uart interrupt.
			Reason: Log uart is shared by km0 and km4. When data are input, both pending interrupt register in km0 and km4 are set, but only one core will process the interrupt.
			
		9,	Add wifi softap start and stop handler
		
		10, Fix MP Bug
			Symptom: ContinuousTx may not Tx packet actually in some cmd flow
			Reaon:	BB register setting wrong value may cause Tx fail in MP continuousTx mode
			
		11,	Optimize KRACK Test 
		
		12, Support for antenna diversity SP3T
		
		13,	Fix BLE Bug
			Symptom: Mix use of different BLE example's AT commands may cause unknown error.
			Reason: Mix use of different BLE example's AT commands should not be allowed.
		
		14,	Fix BLE Mesh Bug
			Symptom: Within mesh example, when wifi is connected, there is sometimes pb adv link open fail or link busy problem.
			Reason: When wifi is connected, coex tdma mechanism is working, making a 100ms TBTT to separated wifi and bt slot. So there is a possibility the pb adv connect ack sending from responser will locate in the wifi slot, making the pbadv con procedure time out.
		
		15,	Optimize BLE Log
			Symptom: The log of BLE read & write is shown unclear.
			Reason: The format of BLE read & write log should be optimized.
